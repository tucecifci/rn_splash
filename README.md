## üí° Technologies Used

### 1. **JavaScript**
- Used to handle logic and user interactions, such as form submission and validation feedback.

### 2. **React Native**
- **Component-based architecture**: The app is structured into reusable components like the splash screen and login form.
- **State Management**: React Native's state mechanism, along with libraries like **Formik**, manages form inputs and validation states.
- **React Hooks**: Hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` are used for managing form states and animation lifecycles.

### 3. **StyleSheet (React Native CSS)**
- **Custom Styling**: Provides a clean and minimalist user interface adapted to mobile screens.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app looks good and functions well across various screen sizes and devices.

## ü§î Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
